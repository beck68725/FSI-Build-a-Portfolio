      <h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
        <h2>"Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit..."
        "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain..."</h2>
    
    
        </p> What is Lorem Ipsum?
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
      standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
      type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
      essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
      passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
    
      Why do we use it?
      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
      layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
      using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
      page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
      sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
      purpose (injected humour and the like).
    
    
      Where does it come from?
      Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
      literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College
      in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
      the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
      1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
      This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
      "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
    
      The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
      1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied
      by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
    
      Where can I get some?
      There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some
      form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a
      passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the
      Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true
      generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
      structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
      repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

    <!-- 
      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
